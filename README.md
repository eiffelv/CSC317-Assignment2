This is a website created purely with HTML5 and CSS. This is an exercise to properly layout a website for my CSC 317 assignment. The website also demonstrates using Scalable Vector Graphics to embed images that do not lose quality even when scaled to larger sizes.

## How do I access the website? (Instructions)
Accessing my website is simple! Click on this link: [https://eiffelv.github.io/CSC317-Assignment2/](https://eiffelv.github.io/CSC317-Assignment2/)
